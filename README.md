# Privacy Preserving Information Access Project

Project Description
-----
The Project focuses on testing and implementing Geomasking Techinques to protect geographical data. In particular it applies geomasking methods to anonymize the locations in a dataset of geotagged tweets, measuring then the performance of the techniques that were used.
